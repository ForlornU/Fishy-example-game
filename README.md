# Fishy Game Template for Godot

![alt text](https://github.com/ForlornU/Images/blob/main/FishyScreenshot1.png)

A starter/template project inspired by the classic flash game "Fishy". Built with Godot Engine version 4.2.1 and serves as a resource for other developers to use and learn from. In this game, you control a fish using the WASD or arrow keys. Your goal is to avoid larger fish and eat smaller fish to grow. As you grow, you will eventually reach a size where you can win the game.

## Features

- Player fish that grows in size by eating smaller fish
- Enemy fish that spawn from the edges of the screen and move across
- Dynamic spawning system for enemies and the player
- Autoload system for managing global game settings and state
- Tween animations for smooth transitions and effects
