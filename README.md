# Fishy Game Template for Godot

//Screenshots here

A starter/template project inspired by the classic flash game "Fishy". Built with Godot Engine version 4.2.1 and serves as a resource for other developers to use and learn from. In this game, you control a fish using the WASD or arrow keys. Your goal is to avoid larger fish and eat smaller fish to grow. As you grow, you will eventually reach a size where you can win the game.

## Features
